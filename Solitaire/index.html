<p>Solitaire is my first game made with Godot Engine and I quickly fell in love with it&rsquo;s workspace. The scene editor is especially good for 2D projects and comes close to the look of Unity&rsquo;s scene editor, which made it easy for me to get used to. The incredible feature of Godot is the built-in code editor with it&rsquo;s own language - gdscript. This programming language is very easy to understand and to write since the documentation is well made. Overall, I had fun making this project.</p>
<p>The idea of making this game came from school. I was sitting bored in computer science and played some random browser games, like all the others. I realized that I could use this time to make a game instead of playing one. This would help me improve my skills and the time won&rsquo;t go to waste. So I made a solitaire game.</p>
<p>The pixel art turned out fantastic: just look at the Jack card, the face is hilarious xD. For the coding, I had 2 approaches, I could take. The first being the easiest: moving card-objects around. Or the second being the best performing one: having fixed card positions and changing their appearance according to the game. I took the harder second approach, because I wanted to have a greater challenge. In the end, I added some shortcuts and kept one bug. The bug is included to boost the probability that the solitaire game is possible, because according to the website &ldquo;solitaire365.com&rdquo; every fifth game is impossible. Try to find the bug ;).</p>
<h1 id="game-rules">Game rules</h1>
<p>The table consists of 7 <strong>piles</strong>. The first pile having 1 card, the second pile having 2 cards and so forth. The first card on each pile is faced up, while the rest is faced down.
The rest of the cards are collected into a big <strong>stock</strong>.
The goal of the game is to collect every card of each 4 types in order - ace, 2, 3, &hellip; Jack, Queen, King.</p>
<p>You can move faced up cards on the piles onto other piles, <strong>if</strong> the card you are holding is the opposite color of the other <strong>and</strong> it is smaller by 1.
The stock can be used by looking at every card one by one and taking a card if needed.
The general strategy is to use the stock as your last option, because the stock cards are always available.</p>
<h1 id="download">Download</h1>
<p>I would recommend, using the browser version first and if you feel the need to play it offline, you can download it any time.
