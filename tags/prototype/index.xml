      <description>This is my experience trying to create smoothies myself instead of browsing recipies on the internet.
Why did I try to create new smoothies fully from scratch? Everyones taste is different and therefore not all smoothies can be seen as tasty by all. There is no perfect combination of healthy fruits, that everyone will like, but this is not my goal. My goal is to create smoothies that I like and that I find tasty.</description>

      <description>Description What is Snappy? Snappy was created during the Covid pandemic to make wearing a mask a more elegant solution.
