      <description>This is my experience trying to create smoothies myself instead of browsing recipies on the internet.
Why did I try to create new smoothies fully from scratch? Everyone&amp;rsquo;s taste is different, therefore not all smoothies can be seen as tasty by everyone. There is no perfect combination of healthy fruits, that everyone will like, but this is not my goal. My goal is to create smoothies that I like, find tasty and can drink every day.</description>

      <description>Description What is Snappy? Snappy was created during the Covid pandemic to make wearing a mask a more elegant solution.
The normal approach in the pandemic was to take a mask everywhere you go and anytime someone comes close or you enter a building, you had to pop on your mask. This has two major problems: you could forget your mask at home and you need two free hands to place it over your nose.</description>

      <description>About me Hi, my name is Purpurax. I love anything that involves coding, but I especially love the automating part of a project - making the project independent.
I not only love automation in my projects, but also in my daily life. I see a future of absolute and pure efficiency, where everything is controlled by a flawless machine. This would make the most out of us humans. More reliable, productive and smarter.</description>

      <description>Description Hexagon Spin tests your reflexes and more. Your goal is to top your high score and buy all the shop items. The game is too slow and easy? Then try the new difficulties and if you are up for a challenge, then color madness is for you. In easy mode, the puzzles come slow and vertically, so you have plenty of time to spin your hexagon to the right position.</description>

      <description>my motive Solitaire is my first game made with Godot Engine and I quickly fell in love with it&amp;rsquo;s workspace. The scene editor is especially good for 2D projects and comes close to the look of Unity&amp;rsquo;s scene editor, which made it easy for me to get used to. The incredible feature of Godot is the built-in code editor with it&amp;rsquo;s own language - gdscript. This programming language is very easy to understand and to write since the documentation is well made.</description>
